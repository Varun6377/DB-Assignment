1. The relationship between the "product" and "product_Category" entities from the diagram is a one-to-many relationship, where one product can belong to only one product category, but a product category can have multiple products associated with it.

2. To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, a foreign key constraint is applied to the "category_id" column within the "Product" table. This constraint ensures that each product must have a valid category ID that corresponds to an existing category in the Product_Category" table.
